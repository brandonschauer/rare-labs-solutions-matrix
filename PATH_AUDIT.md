# HTML File Location and Asset Path Audit

## Current Structure

### Source HTML File
- **Location**: `index.html` (project root)
- **Asset references**:
  - `src="/src/main.tsx"` - Absolute path (development)
  - `href="/vite.svg"` - Absolute path (optional favicon)

### Built HTML File  
- **Location**: `dist/index.html` (in `dist/` subfolder)
- **Asset references**:
  - `src="/rare-labs-solutions-matrix/assets/index-TUNqqT_b.js"` - Absolute path with base prefix
  - `href="/vite.svg"` - Absolute path

### Asset Locations
- **JS/CSS assets**: `dist/assets/` (same directory as `dist/index.html`)
- **CSV file**: `dist/` (same directory as `dist/index.html`)

## Analysis

Since `dist/index.html` and `dist/assets/` are in the **same directory level** (`dist/`), relative paths should use `./assets/` (same directory), NOT `../assets/` (parent directory).

However, the current `dist/index.html` uses **absolute paths** with the base prefix `/rare-labs-solutions-matrix/assets/...`, which is correct for Vite's base configuration but not relative paths.

## Recommendation

If converting to relative paths:
- From `dist/index.html` to `dist/assets/index-*.js`: Should be `./assets/index-*.js`
- From `dist/index.html` to `dist/bertin_*.csv`: Should be `./bertin_*.csv`

**Note**: The `dist/index.html` file is auto-generated by Vite build, so changes should be made via `vite.config.ts` base configuration, not by editing `dist/index.html` directly.
